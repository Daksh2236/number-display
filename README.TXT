1.  The Class diagram is persistent, it gets saved and when you create objects they aren't saved (they won't get sent to git)

2   They can change when creating a new class

3.  They can change when creating a new object

5.  When the call increment on minutes has hit 59 and it has rolled over then increment should be called on hours

8.  They will not result in a store value because when you call with out the semicolon it can't run the method and when you do it with a value higher than the limit it will not set the value

10. Error: non-static method getValue() cannot be referenced from a static context

11. Error: '.class' expected

13. replacementValue = limit 

14. Any value that is under 0 and is under the limit will be some invalid parameter values

15. ! false
    (34 != 33) && ! false
    because the ! is used as a NOT operator

16. a && b ! false

17. a || b && ! false

18. The number will rollback at 999 if the limit is 1000
    you do not get back a 2 digit string you get a 3 diggit string
    
19. no there is a not difference because there is nothing in the ""

20. yes it did suprise me the results are what they are because it reads "cat"+ 3 so then it adds the 3 and then the 9 rather than 9 + 3 + "cat" its doing the addition then adding the word
